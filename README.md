This repository contains a collection of useful, well-documented code snippets to help you get started with machine learning for chemistry with a special focus on polymer science.

ðŸš§ Ongoing Development

This repository is actively maintained, and more code and examples will be added over time, though not on a fixed schedule. Feel free to message me with questions you might have or examples you want to see.
